// Queue - FIFO...
/*
The queue data structure is a sequential collection of elements that follows the principle of First In First Out (FIFO)
The first element inserted into the queue is first element to be removed
A queue of people. People enter the queue at one end (rear/tail) and leave the queue from the other end (front/ head).
Queue is an abstract data type. It is defined by its behavior rather than being a mathematical model
The Queue data structure supports two main operations
Enqueue, which adds an element to the rear/tail of the collection
Dequeue, which removes an element from the front/head of the collection
